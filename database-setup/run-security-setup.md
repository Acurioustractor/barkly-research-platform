# Run Security Foundation Setup

## 🚀 **Ready to Execute**

The security foundation SQL has been validated and is ready to run:

- ✅ **10 Security Functions** - Authentication, authorization, cultural protection
- ✅ **3 Core Tables** - Communities, user profiles, documents with RLS
- ✅ **12 RLS Policies** - Comprehensive access control
- ✅ **Audit System** - Complete logging and monitoring
- ✅ **Cultural Protection** - Indigenous data sovereignty enforcement

## 📋 **Steps to Run**

### 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
- Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard
- Select project: `gkwzdnzwpfpkvgpcbeeq`
- Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

### 2. Execute Security Foundation
- Create a new query in SQL Editor
- Copy the entire contents of `database-setup/02-security-foundation.sql`
- Paste into the SQL Editor
- Click "Run" to execute

### 3. Verify Installation
After running the SQL, you should see output like:
```
Security Setup Validation:
✅ Row Level Security: OK
✅ Audit Triggers: OK  
✅ Security Functions: OK
✅ RLS Policies: OK

Security Metrics:
- audit_entries_24h: 0
- active_communities: 0
- documents_by_sensitivity: 0

Cultural Data Access Test:
✅ Public data access: true
🚫 Sacred data access: false
```

### 4. Test the Setup
Run the comprehensive test:
```bash
node test-security-setup.js
```

## 🎯 **What This Creates**

### 🏛️ **Indigenous Data Sovereignty**
- Community-owned data with cultural sensitivity levels
- Sacred data protection with special access controls
- CARE+ principles embedded in database policies
- Complete audit trail for cultural data access

### 🔒 **Enterprise Security**
- Row Level Security on all sensitive tables
- JWT-based authentication with community roles
- Comprehensive audit logging with triggers
- Automated threat detection and alerting

### 📊 **Three Core Tables**
1. **Communities** - Indigenous communities with data governance
2. **User Profiles** - Users with community relationships and cultural context
3. **Documents** - Research documents with cultural sensitivity controls

### 🛡️ **12 Security Policies**
- Communities: 4 policies (view, create, update, delete)
- User Profiles: 4 policies (view own, view community, create, update)
- Documents: 4 policies (cultural access, upload, update, delete)

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

### Security Features
- **Cultural Sensitivity Levels**: public, community, restricted, sacred
- **Community-based Access**: Users can only access their community's data
- **Role-based Permissions**: Different access levels for different roles
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every operation logged with user context

### Data Sovereignty
- **Community Ownership**: Every document belongs to a specific community
- **Cultural Protocols**: Embedded respect for Indigenous data practices
- **Access Transparency**: Full visibility into who accesses what data
- **Community Control**: Communities set their own data governance policies

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### If You Get Errors
1. **Function exists errors**: These are normal - functions are being updated
2. **Permission errors**: Some operations may need different privileges
3. **Table exists errors**: Normal - tables are created with IF NOT EXISTS

### If Tests Fail
1. Check that all SQL executed without critical errors
2. Verify RLS is enabled on tables
3. Confirm security functions were created
4. Test cultural data access functions

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

After successful setup, you should have:
- ✅ All security functions created and working
- ✅ RLS enabled on communities, user_profiles, documents tables
- ✅ 12+ RLS policies enforcing access control
- ✅ Audit triggers logging all operations
- ✅ Cultural data protection working correctly
- ✅ Security monitoring and metrics active

## 🚀 **Ready for Task 3**

Once this security foundation is in place, we'll be ready for:
**Task 3: Create community management system**
- Community registration and configuration
- Data governance policy management
- Cultural protocol enforcement
- Community administrator tools

The security foundation provides the bulletproof base for everything else!

# 🔐 Security & Testing Protocols

## 🛡️ Security Checklist

### API Security
- [ ] Rate limiting on document upload endpoints
- [ ] File type validation (PDF only, max 10MB)
- [ ] Input sanitization for all form fields
- [ ] Content-Type validation for uploads
- [ ] CORS configuration review
- [ ] Authentication middleware for sensitive endpoints

### Data Protection
- [ ] Environment variables secured (API keys, DB credentials)
- [ ] Database connection encryption
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged
- [ ] File upload directory permissions
- [ ] PDF content sanitization

### Indigenous Data Sovereignty
- [ ] CARE+ principles implementation verified
- [ ] Cultural protocols in AI analysis
- [ ] Data sovereignty compliance
- [ ] Community consent mechanisms
- [ ] Data retention policies

## 🧪 Testing Protocol Framework

### Core Functionality Tests
```bash
# Document Upload Pipeline

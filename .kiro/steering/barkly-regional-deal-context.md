# Barkly Regional Deal Context

This document provides the foundational context for all development work on the Barkly Community Intelligence Platform, based on the comprehensive Barkly Regional Deal framework.

## Core Philosophy & Vision

**Community Vision**: "Strong Barkly communities and families, together determining our future and thriving in both worlds."

The Barkly Regional Deal (BRD) is a 10-year, $100.5 million commitment from three tiers of government to improve productivity and liveability of the Barkly region by stimulating economic growth, improving social outcomes and supporting Aboriginal leadership.

## Key Principles & Ways of Working

1. **Aboriginal Leadership**: Aboriginal leadership is critical to the success of the Barkly Regional Deal
2. **Community-Led**: All initiatives must be driven by community needs and priorities
3. **Cultural Safety**: Respect for Indigenous knowledge systems and protocols, including Traditional Owner consultation
4. **Youth-Centered**: Focus on empowering young people as agents of change
5. **Evidence-Based**: Decisions informed by data and community insights through Understanding, Measuring, Evaluation and Learning (UMEL) frameworks
6. **Collaborative**: Multi-stakeholder approach involving three tiers of government, NGOs, and community
7. **Mutual Respect**: Work collaboratively with all stakeholders based on mutual respect, understanding and acceptance of differences
8. **Accountability**: Accountable to the community and each other
9. **Strength-Based**: Build on strengths and grow capability

## Governance Structure

- **Governance Table**: Representatives from communities across the Barkly region with Independent Chair (transitioning to local Chair)
- **Barkly Aboriginal Alliance (BAA)**: Critical Aboriginal leadership body
- **Backbone Team**: Independent coordination and strategic support
- **Working Groups**: Specialized groups for different initiative areas
- **Three Government Partners**: Australian Government ($51.7M), Northern Territory Government ($45.8M), Barkly Regional Council ($3M)

### Key Challenges

### Cultural Considerations

## Platform Development Implications

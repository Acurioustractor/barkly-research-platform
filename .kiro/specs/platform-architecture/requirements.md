# Barkly Research Platform - Core Architecture & Strategic Overview

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Barkly Research Platform's architecture, aligning backend database design with frontend functionality to support the Barkly Regional Deal's community-led intelligence system. The platform respects Aboriginal cultural protocols while delivering powerful insights for evidence-based decision making.

## Core Philosophy & Principles

### Cultural Safety First
- **Data Sovereignty**: Aboriginal communities maintain ownership and control over their data
- **Cultural Protocols**: Three-tier access system (Public, Community, Sacred) with Elder oversight
- **Consent Management**: Explicit consent tracking for all cultural knowledge sharing
- **Two-Way Learning**: Integration of traditional knowledge with contemporary systems

### Community-Led Intelligence
- **Self-Determination**: Communities define their own success metrics and priorities
- **Participatory Design**: Youth, Elders, and community members shape platform development
- **Transparent Governance**: Open tracking of BRD initiatives and decision-making processes
- **Evidence-Based**: AI-powered insights support but don't replace community wisdom

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Cultural Data Management System

**User Story:** As a community member, I want my cultural knowledge to be protected by appropriate protocols, so that sacred and sensitive information is only shared with proper permissions and Elder approval.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL require cultural sensitivity classification (Public, Community, Sacred)
2. WHEN sacred content is accessed THEN the system SHALL require Elder approval before display
3. WHEN community content is requested THEN the system SHALL verify community membership
4. WHEN consent is withdrawn THEN the system SHALL immediately restrict access to affected content
5. IF Elder approval is pending THEN the system SHALL queue content for review
6. WHEN cultural protocols are violated THEN the system SHALL log incidents and notify administrators

### Requirement 2: BRD Initiative Tracking & Governance

**User Story:** As a BRD governance board member, I want to track progress across all 28 initiatives with transparent community accountability, so that we can demonstrate impact and adjust strategies based on evidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an initiative is created THEN the system SHALL capture budget, timeline, stakeholders, and community input requirements
2. WHEN progress is updated THEN the system SHALL track milestones, barriers, enablers, and outcomes
3. WHEN decisions are made THEN the system SHALL record decision makers, consultation process, and implementation dates
4. WHEN community reports are generated THEN the system SHALL include progress metrics and community feedback
5. IF initiatives are behind schedule THEN the system SHALL flag for governance attention
6. WHEN stakeholders access reports THEN the system SHALL provide role-appropriate views

### Requirement 3: Youth Voice Amplification System

**User Story:** As a young person in the Barkly, I want my priorities and ideas to be heard and tracked through the Youth Roundtable process, so that youth perspectives influence community decisions and resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN youth priorities are identified THEN the system SHALL capture category, description, support level, and status
2. WHEN roundtable discussions occur THEN the system SHALL track participation, outcomes, and action items
3. WHEN youth feedback is provided THEN the system SHALL link to relevant BRD initiatives
4. WHEN safe house needs are expressed THEN the system SHALL prioritize and track implementation
5. IF youth engagement drops THEN the system SHALL alert community coordinators
6. WHEN success stories emerge THEN the system SHALL facilitate appropriate sharing

### Requirement 4: Training & Employment Pipeline Management

**User Story:** As a training coordinator, I want to track student journeys from enrollment through employment with cultural mentoring support, so that we can improve completion rates and employment outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN students enroll THEN the system SHALL capture pathway, cultural mentoring preferences, and support needs
2. WHEN progress is tracked THEN the system SHALL monitor completion rates, barriers, and enabler factors
3. WHEN employment outcomes occur THEN the system SHALL link to training programs and measure retention
4. WHEN cultural mentoring is provided THEN the system SHALL track mentor-student relationships and outcomes
5. IF completion rates decline THEN the system SHALL identify contributing factors
6. WHEN employers engage THEN the system SHALL track partnerships and job creation

### Requirement 5: AI-Powered Document Intelligence

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want AI analysis of community documents to identify themes, patterns, and insights while respecting cultural protocols, so that evidence-based recommendations can support community decision-making.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are processed THEN the system SHALL extract themes, entities, and sentiment while respecting access controls
2. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate insights appropriate to user's cultural access level
3. WHEN patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL highlight success factors and improvement opportunities
4. WHEN cross-document analysis occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain cultural sensitivity boundaries
5. IF sacred content is detected THEN the system SHALL flag for Elder review before processing
6. WHEN insights are generated THEN the system SHALL cite sources and confidence levels

### Requirement 6: Systems Change & Policy Impact Tracking

**User Story:** As a policy advocate, I want to track systemic changes in government and service delivery systems, so that we can measure policy impact and identify areas needing further transformation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN systems changes are identified THEN the system SHALL capture target system, change type, stakeholders, and expected outcomes
2. WHEN policy impacts occur THEN the system SHALL track beneficiaries, implementation status, and community feedback
3. WHEN barriers are encountered THEN the system SHALL document obstacles and potential solutions
4. WHEN successes are achieved THEN the system SHALL capture lessons learned and replication opportunities
5. IF changes stall THEN the system SHALL alert advocacy coordinators
6. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL show progress across multiple system domains

### Requirement 7: Community Story & Knowledge Sharing

**User Story:** As a community storyteller, I want to share my experiences and cultural knowledge through appropriate protocols, so that our stories can inspire others while respecting cultural boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN stories are submitted THEN the system SHALL guide users through cultural protocol requirements
2. WHEN Elder review is needed THEN the system SHALL facilitate approval workflow
3. WHEN consent is provided THEN the system SHALL track permissions and withdrawal rights
4. WHEN stories are shared THEN the system SHALL respect access level restrictions
5. IF cultural violations are reported THEN the system SHALL investigate and take appropriate action
6. WHEN stories inspire action THEN the system SHALL track community impact

### Requirement 8: Real-Time Platform Health & Analytics

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want comprehensive system monitoring and user analytics, so that I can ensure platform reliability and understand community engagement patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system components are monitored THEN the system SHALL track uptime, performance, and error rates
2. WHEN users engage THEN the system SHALL capture usage patterns while respecting privacy
3. WHEN issues occur THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and log incidents
4. WHEN analytics are generated THEN the system SHALL provide insights on community engagement
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically scale resources
6. WHEN reports are requested THEN the system SHALL generate platform health summaries

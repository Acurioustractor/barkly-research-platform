# Elder Consultation - Cultural Protocols for Platform
**Date:** February 28, 2024  
**Location:** Nyinkka Nyunyu Art & Culture Centre  
**Participants:** 5 Elders, 2 Community Coordinators  
**Cultural Sensitivity:** Community Level  

## Purpose

Consultation with Elders regarding appropriate cultural protocols for the Barkly Research Platform, ensuring Aboriginal data sovereignty and respectful knowledge sharing.

## Key Guidance Provided

### Three-Tier Access System
Elders endorsed the proposed three-tier system:

**Public Level:**
- General community achievements and success stories
- Policy documents and government reports
- Training program information and outcomes
- Employment statistics and opportunities

**Community Level:**
- Community-specific challenges and solutions
- Local cultural activities and events (non-sacred)
- Community consultation outcomes
- Local governance discussions

**Sacred Level:**
- Traditional knowledge and practices
- Ceremonial information
- Sacred site references
- Gender-specific cultural content
- Requires individual Elder approval for each access request

### Elder Approval Process
- Minimum 2 Elders must review sacred content
- 48-hour minimum review period for sacred content decisions
- Right to withdraw approval at any time
- Community notification when sacred content is accessed
- Annual review of all sacred content classifications

### Data Sovereignty Principles
"Our data, our stories, our control" - Elder Mary Wilson

Key principles established:
- Community owns all data about their people and country
- Right to withdraw consent and remove content
- No external sharing without explicit community permission
- Regular community reporting on how data is being used
- Community benefit must be clear and ongoing

### Youth and Elder Connection
Strong emphasis on connecting youth with Elders through the platform:
- Youth stories should include Elder perspectives where appropriate
- Traditional knowledge shared only with proper cultural context
- Two-way learning opportunities highlighted
- Respect for both traditional and contemporary knowledge

## Specific Platform Recommendations

### Story Sharing Guidelines
1. Always ask: "Who should hear this story?"
2. Consider: "What is the cultural context needed?"
3. Ensure: "Is this helping or harming our community?"
4. Remember: "Stories have power - use them wisely"

### Cultural Mentoring Integration
- All training programs should include cultural mentoring options
- Mentors should be matched based on cultural connections
- Regular check-ins between mentors and participants
- Recognition and support for cultural mentors

### Community Consultation Process
- Major platform changes require community consultation
- Regular community meetings to discuss platform use
- Feedback mechanisms that respect cultural communication styles
- Option for face-to-face discussions, not just digital feedback

## Concerns Raised

### Technology Barriers
- Some Elders concerned about digital divide
- Need for face-to-face support and training
- Importance of maintaining non-digital communication options
- Platform should enhance, not replace, traditional communication

### Cultural Appropriation Risks
- Concern about non-Aboriginal people misusing cultural information
- Need for clear guidelines on appropriate use of cultural content
- Importance of context and relationship in cultural knowledge sharing
- Regular monitoring of how cultural content is being accessed and used

## Commitments Made

### By Platform Developers
- Monthly Elder advisory meetings
- Cultural protocol training for all platform administrators
- Community-controlled data governance structure
- Regular cultural impact assessments

### By Community
- Elder volunteers for ongoing cultural oversight
- Community feedback on platform development
- Support for youth engagement with platform
- Advocacy for appropriate funding and resources

## Next Steps

1. **Cultural Advisory Committee** - Establish formal Elder advisory group
2. **Protocol Documentation** - Create detailed cultural protocol guidelines
3. **Community Training** - Develop community training programs for platform use
4. **Regular Review** - Quarterly review of cultural protocol effectiveness

## Cultural Note

This consultation was conducted according to traditional protocols with appropriate cultural guidance. All Elders consented to sharing these general principles for platform development. Specific cultural knowledge discussed remains confidential to the consultation group.

**Impact on BRD:** This consultation directly informs the cultural framework for all 28 BRD initiatives, ensuring Aboriginal leadership and data sovereignty principles are embedded throughout the platform.

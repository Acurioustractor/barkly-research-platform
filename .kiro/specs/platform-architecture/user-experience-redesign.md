# User Experience Redesign - Community-Centered Platform

## Current State vs. Desired State

### Current State: Information Display Platform
- **Pages show data** → Users consume information
- **One-way input** → Community submits, platform stores
- **Static dashboards** → Numbers and charts without context
- **Complex navigation** → Users get lost between sections
- **Technical language** → Barriers to community participation

### Desired State: Community Empowerment Platform
- **Interactive tools** → Users shape priorities and decisions
- **Two-way dialogue** → Community input leads to visible action
- **Living dashboards** → Real-time community engagement and progress
- **Intuitive flows** → Clear paths from input to impact
- **Community language** → Accessible, culturally appropriate communication

## Redesigned User Journeys

### 1. **Community Member Journey: "I want to influence decisions"**

#### Current Journey (Broken)
```
Home → Overwhelmed by BRD jargon
↓
Heat Map → Interesting but can't interact
↓
Community Input → Submit form into void
↓
No feedback → Disengagement
```

#### Redesigned Journey (Empowering)
```
Community Hub → See current priorities and my community's voice
↓
Add My Voice → Interactive priority setting with immediate feedback
↓
Community Discussion → See others' input, build on ideas
↓
Track Progress → See how my input influences decisions
↓
Celebrate Success → Share in community achievements
```

### 2. **Youth Journey: "I want my voice heard and to connect with peers"**

#### Current Journey (Limiting)
```
Youth Dashboard → Static display of priorities
↓
No interaction → Can only view, not participate
↓
Isolation → No connection to other youth
```

#### Redesigned Journey (Connecting)
```
Youth Hub → See peer priorities and discussions
↓
Voice My Priorities → Interactive priority setting with peer voting
↓
Connect with Peers → Discussion spaces and collaboration tools
↓
Lead Action → Youth-led initiative planning and implementation
↓
Mentor Others → Share success and support new participants
```

### 3. **Elder Journey: "I want to guide cultural protocols and share wisdom"**

#### Current Journey (Complex)
```
Stories Page → Complex cultural protocol system
↓
Approval Process → Unclear workflow
↓
Limited Oversight → No tools for ongoing guidance
```

#### Redesigned Journey (Guiding)
```
Cultural Guidance Hub → Clear overview of content needing review
↓
Review & Approve → Streamlined approval workflow
↓
Share Wisdom → Tools for adding cultural context and guidance
↓
Monitor Impact → See how cultural protocols are working
↓
Community Teaching → Opportunities to share knowledge appropriately
```

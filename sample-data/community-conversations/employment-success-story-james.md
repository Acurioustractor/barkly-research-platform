**Date:** March 8, 2024  
**Storyteller:** James Thompson (with permission)  
**Community:** Tennant Creek  
**Cultural Sensitivity:** Public  
**Program:** Certificate II Community Services â†’ Community Support Worker  

## Background

James, 23, completed his Certificate II in Community Services through the Barkly Regional Training program in late 2023. He is now employed as a Community Support Worker with Barkly Regional Council.

## The Journey

### Starting Point
"I was on CDP (Community Development Program) for two years and wasn't getting anywhere. My cousin told me about the training program and said they had good support for Aboriginal students. I was nervous because I'd dropped out of school early, but I thought I'd give it a try."

### Training Experience
"The best part was having Uncle Billy as my cultural mentor. When I was struggling with the coursework, he'd help me understand how the Western way of learning connected to our traditional ways of helping community. That made it click for me."

**Key Success Factors:**
- Cultural mentoring with Uncle Billy (Elder and experienced community worker)
- Flexible delivery allowing for cultural obligations
- Practical placements in local Aboriginal organizations
- Peer support from other Aboriginal students
- Two-way learning approach incorporating traditional knowledge

### Challenges Overcome
"The hardest part was the written assignments. I'm better at talking and doing than writing. My mentor helped me understand that my way of communicating was valuable too. The trainers worked with me to do some assessments through presentations instead of just written work."

**Barriers Addressed:**
- Academic writing challenges
- Confidence in formal education settings
- Balancing study with family responsibilities
- Transport to training venues
- Financial pressures during training period

### Employment Outcome
"Now I'm working with families in crisis, helping them navigate services and connect with support. It's exactly what I wanted to do - help my community using both my training and my cultural knowledge."

**Current Role Details:**
- Position: Community Support Worker
- Employer: Barkly Regional Council
- Start Date: January 15, 2024
- Employment Type: Full-time permanent
- Salary: $55,000 per year
- Cultural mentoring: Ongoing with workplace Elder advisor

## Community Impact

### Direct Impact
- Supporting 15-20 families per month through crisis intervention
- Connecting community members to appropriate services
- Providing cultural bridge between mainstream services and Aboriginal families
- Mentoring new trainees in the program

### Broader Influence
"Other young fellas see that it's possible. Three of my cousins have now enrolled in training programs. When community sees one of their own succeed, it gives them hope too."

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked
1. **Cultural Mentoring:** "Having Uncle Billy made all the difference"
2. **Flexible Delivery:** Accommodating cultural obligations and learning styles
3. **Local Placement:** Training in familiar community context
4. **Peer Support:** Learning alongside other Aboriginal students
5. **Employer Partnership:** Council committed to Aboriginal employment

### Recommendations for Other Programs
"Make sure there's proper cultural support, not just academic support. Connect students with Elders who understand both worlds. And give employers training too - they need to understand our cultural responsibilities."

## Future Goals

"I want to do my Certificate III next year and eventually become a team leader. I also want to help design training programs that work better for our people. We know what we need - we just need the system to listen."

**Career Development Plan:**
- Certificate III in Community Services (2025)
- Leadership development program
- Cultural competency training for mainstream services
- Potential role in training program design and delivery

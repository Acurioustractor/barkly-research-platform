## Recommended Visual Storytelling Using the Governance Structure

### 1. **The Governance Journey Map**
Create a flow showing:
- **Start**: Community voices and needs (quotes from youth)
- **Process**: Through governance table and working groups
- **Outcome**: Real initiatives and programs
- **Feedback**: Back to community through Backbone Team

### 2. **The Accountability Web**
Using the circular governance structure:
- **Centre**: Youth voices and quotes
- **Inner ring**: Working groups processing these voices
- **Middle ring**: Governance principles in action
- **Outer ring**: Concrete outcomes and initiatives

### 3. **The Two Worlds Integration**
Visualizing how quotes support "thriving in both worlds":
- **Wumpurani side**: Cultural quotes, Elder wisdom, traditional knowledge
- **Papulanji side**: Service delivery, programs, western systems
- **Middle Space**: Youth navigating both, governance table facilitating

### 4. **The Accountability Arrow**
Show how community voice flows through the system:
1. Youth speak (quotes) → 
2. Backbone Team collects → 
3. Working Groups analyze → 
4. Governance Table decides → 
5. Programs implement → 
6. Community evaluates → 
7. Cycle continues

## Strategic Quote Placement on Governance Diagram

### Around the Governance Table:
- "Putting young people at the centre"
- "Everyone working together"
- "Wilya manu marlungku-ku anyul nyirrinta mappungku akila-ka"

### Near Working Groups:
- Specific quotes related to each group's focus
- Youth quotes about what they need from services
- Community feedback on what's working/not working

### Connected to Backbone Team:
- "We use data to reflect and improve"
- "We need a voice for kids to be heard - not just surveys"
- Quotes about continuous learning and adaptation

### Linked to Priority Domains:
- Place relevant quotes as evidence for why each domain matters
- Show how community voice shaped these priorities
- Connect quotes to specific initiatives under each domain

## Visual Design Recommendations

1. **Color Coordination**
   - Maintain the green/orange color scheme from governance diagram
   - Add youth quotes in vibrant colors to show energy
   - Elder wisdom in earth tones for grounding

2. **Flow Indicators**
   - Use arrows to show how quotes influence decisions
   - Dotted lines for feedback loops
   - Solid lines for direct connections

3. **Layered Information**
   - Base layer: Governance structure
   - Second layer: Community quotes as evidence
   - Third layer: Outcomes and initiatives
   - Top layer: Continuous feedback and adaptation

4. **Interactive Elements**
   - Click on any priority domain to see supporting quotes
   - Hover over working groups to see their youth-related work
   - Touch points showing where youth voice enters the system

This integrated approach shows that youth voices aren't just isolated quotes but are fundamental inputs into a sophisticated governance system designed to turn community wisdom into concrete action. The quotes provide the "why" behind each priority domain and governance principle, making the entire system more transparent and accountable to the community it serves.

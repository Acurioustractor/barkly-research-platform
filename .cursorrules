- Use semantic HTML and proper ARIA labels
- Write comprehensive JSDoc comments

## Component Architecture
- Build modular, reusable components
- Separate visualization logic from data logic
- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Design for multi-project scalability

## Data Handling
- Use immutable data patterns
- Implement proper loading states
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Cache expensive computations
- Support offline functionality where possible

## Cultural Sensitivity
- Always respect Indigenous data sovereignty
- Follow CARE+ principles (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, Ethics + Cultural safety)
- Implement appropriate access controls
- Use inclusive language and imagery
- Allow for customization of cultural elements

## Performance
- Optimize for mobile devices
- Implement code splitting
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Optimize images and assets
- Monitor bundle size

## Accessibility
- Ensure keyboard navigation works everywhere
- Provide proper focus management
- Use sufficient color contrast
- Support screen readers
- Implement proper heading hierarchy

## When building new features:
1. Consider how it scales to other projects
2. Think about cultural appropriateness

# Security Foundation Implementation Summary

## üîí **World-Class Security for Indigenous Data Sovereignty**

This security foundation implements comprehensive protection for the Barkly Research Platform, ensuring Indigenous data sovereignty, cultural sensitivity, and world-class security practices.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Core Security Components**

### 1. **Authentication & Authorization Framework**
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Integrates with Supabase Auth
- **Community-based Authorization**: Users belong to communities with specific roles
- **Role-based Access Control**: admin, community_admin, member, analyst_readonly
- **Cultural Keeper Roles**: Special permissions for sacred data access

### 2. **Row Level Security (RLS) Policies**
- **Communities Table**: Community members can only see their own community data
- **User Profiles**: Users can view profiles within their community
- **Documents**: Access controlled by cultural sensitivity levels
- **Audit Log**: Comprehensive logging of all data access

### 3. **Cultural Data Protection System**
- **Four Sensitivity Levels**:
  - `public`: Accessible to all authenticated users
  - `community`: Accessible to community members only
  - `restricted`: Requires admin role within community
  - `sacred`: Requires cultural_keeper role with special permissions
- **CARE+ Principles**: Collective benefit, Authority, Responsibility, Ethics
- **Indigenous Data Sovereignty**: Community ownership and control

### 4. **Comprehensive Audit System**
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every data access, modification, and deletion logged
- **User Activity Tracking**: IP addresses, user agents, session IDs
- **Cultural Data Access Monitoring**: Special tracking for sensitive data
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Automated alerts for unusual patterns

### 5. **Security Monitoring & Alerting**
- **Real-time Metrics**: Active monitoring of security events
- **Threat Detection**: Identifies multiple failed access attempts
- **Sacred Data Alerts**: Notifications when sacred data is accessed
- **Performance Monitoring**: Security impact on database performance

## üìä **Database Tables Created**

### Communities Table
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- name, slug, description
- data_governance_policy (JSONB) - Community-specific rules
- access_restrictions (JSONB) - Visibility and access controls
- cultural_protocols (JSONB) - Cultural guidelines and requirements
- Contact info, dates, system fields
- RLS: Community members can see their community
```

### User Profiles Table
```sql
- id (UUID, references auth.users)
- display_name, avatar_url, bio
- primary_community_id (UUID, references communities)
- community_roles (JSONB) - Multiple community memberships
- research_interests, cultural_background, pronouns
- RLS: Users see their own profile + community members
```

### Documents Table
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- community_id (UUID) - Data ownership
- uploaded_by (UUID) - User who uploaded
- File metadata (name, size, hash, storage_path)
- Content metadata (language, page_count, word_count)
- Processing status and results
- cultural_sensitivity_level - CRITICAL for data sovereignty
- access_restrictions (JSONB) - Additional access controls
- RLS: Access based on cultural sensitivity and community membership
```

### Audit Log Table
```sql
- Complete tracking of all database operations
- User identification and community context
- Old/new values for change tracking
- IP addresses and session information
- Timestamp and operation type
```

## üîß **Security Functions Implemented**

### Authentication Functions
- `is_authenticated()` - Check if user is logged in
- `get_user_community_id()` - Get user's primary community
- `get_user_role()` - Get user's role from JWT
- `is_community_admin()` - Check admin permissions

### Cultural Data Protection
- `can_access_cultural_data()` - Enforce cultural sensitivity rules
- `check_cultural_access()` - Core cultural access logic
- Respects Indigenous data sovereignty principles

### Audit & Monitoring
- `log_data_access()` - Log all data access attempts
- `audit_trigger_function()` - Automatic audit logging
- `detect_suspicious_activity()` - Threat detection
- `get_security_metrics()` - Security monitoring

### Validation & Testing
- `validate_security_setup()` - Comprehensive security validation
- Automated testing of all security components

## üö® **Security Policies Enforced**

### Community Data Sovereignty
1. **Data Ownership**: Every document belongs to a community
2. **Community Control**: Communities control access to their data
3. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Four-tier sensitivity system enforced
4. **Audit Transparency**: Complete visibility into data access

### Access Control Matrix
| Sensitivity Level | Public User | Community Member | Community Admin | Cultural Keeper |
|------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Public           | ‚úÖ Read     | ‚úÖ Read          | ‚úÖ Read/Write   | ‚úÖ Read/Write   |
| Community        | ‚ùå No Access| ‚úÖ Read          | ‚úÖ Read/Write   | ‚úÖ Read/Write   |
| Restricted       | ‚ùå No Access| ‚ùå No Access     | ‚úÖ Read/Write   | ‚úÖ Read/Write   |
| Sacred           | ‚ùå No Access| ‚ùå No Access     | ‚ùå No Access    | ‚úÖ Read/Write   |

### Audit Requirements
- **All Operations Logged**: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT
- **User Context**: User ID, community ID, role, session
- **Data Changes**: Before/after values for all modifications
- **Access Attempts**: Even failed access attempts are logged
- **Cultural Data**: Special logging for sensitive data access

## üß™ **Testing & Validation**

### Automated Tests
- Security function existence and functionality
- RLS policy enforcement
- Audit trigger activation
- Cultural data protection rules
- Security metrics collection

### Manual Validation
- Run `node test-security-setup.js` for comprehensive testing
- Check Supabase dashboard for policy enforcement
- Verify audit log entries for all operations
- Test cultural sensitivity access controls

# Barkly Platform Architecture Redesign

## Current Problems
- 8+ different upload endpoints causing confusion
- Complex AI processing pipeline with frequent failures
- Poor user feedback during document processing
- Inconsistent error handling across components

## Proposed Solution: Streamlined Architecture

### 1. Single Upload Endpoint
**Keep only:** `/api/documents/upload` (unified)
**Remove:** All other upload-* endpoints

### 2. Simplified Processing Pipeline
```
Upload → Extract → Chunk → Analyze → Store → Notify
```

### 3. Background Processing with Real-time Updates
- Use Vercel's streaming responses for progress updates
- Store processing status in database
- WebSocket-like updates via Server-Sent Events

### 4. Robust Error Recovery
- Retry failed chunks automatically
- Partial success handling (some chunks succeed, others fail)
- Clear error messages with actionable next steps

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Consolidation (Week 1)
1. Create single `/api/documents/upload` endpoint
2. Remove redundant upload APIs
3. Update admin interface to use single endpoint
4. Add proper loading states and progress indicators

### Phase 2: Processing Optimization (Week 2)
1. Implement background job queue
2. Add streaming progress updates
3. Optimize AI analysis for better reliability
4. Add automatic retry mechanisms

### Phase 3: User Experience (Week 3)
1. Create intuitive document management interface
2. Add search and filtering capabilities
3. Implement document collections and tagging
4. Add export and sharing features

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4)
1. Semantic search with embeddings
2. Cross-document analysis and insights
3. Automated report generation
4. Integration with external systems

### Step 5: Test Security Features
```bash
# Test rate limiting (run multiple times quickly)
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/analyze \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"content":"test","analysisType":"quick"}' &
done
wait

# Should see rate limiting headers in responses
```
